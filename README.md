# WindowsPhoneConnector
</br>
</br>
This is the windows phone version of the app used to connect to my local home computer.
</br>
</br>
This app starts by connecting to a socket open on my local computer by the application located on my gitHub called ServerConnecter.
</br>
</br>
This app will then show a simulation of my home computer and a seperate page for settings (Image Qual, click type, etc..) 
</br>
</br>
Holding down a finger on the screen will trigger an update of the screen (progress bar will appear) and a single click is equivalent to a mouse click.
</br>
</br>
My local machine server will then process any command sent to it and return any neccessary data.
